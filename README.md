# Cognifyz_Technologies-Internship
**Java Development Internship**<br>
**#Level1_Task1 completed{Assigned by Cognifyz Technologies}(Date:21/12/2024)[Temperatureconvertor]**.<br>Key features of the program:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Accepts user input for temperature values.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Lets users specify the unit (C for Celsius and F for Fahrenheit).<br>
**#Level1_Task2 completed{Assigned by Cognifyz Technologies}(Date:25/12/2024)[Palindrome checker]**.<br>I created a simple yet efficient Palindrome Checker program in Java that:
‚úÖ Ignores spaces and letter case.
‚úÖ Accepts user input for real-time results.<br>
**#Level1_Task3 completed{Assigned by Cognifyz Technologies}(Date:28/12/2024)[Student Grade Calculator]**.<br>This project allows users to input marks for five subjects and automatically calculates:
‚úÖ Total Marks
‚úÖ Percentage
‚úÖ Grade<br>
**#Level1_Task4 completed{Assigned by Cognifyz Technologies}(Date:29/12/2024)[Random Password Generator]**.<br>Allows users to set the desired password length.
Provides options to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
This project enhances security by generating strong, customizable passwords.<br>
**#Level2_Task1 completed{Assigned by Cognifyz Technologies}(Date:30/12/2024)[Tic Tac Toe Game]**.<br>This program brings the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game to life with an interactive console-based design. It's an excellent example of using arrays, loops, and conditional statements to build engaging logic.<br>
Key Features:<br>
‚úÖ Interactive gameplay for two players<br>
‚úÖ Valid move checks to prevent errors<br>
‚úÖ Win or draw detection after each move<br>
‚úÖ Option to play multiple rounds<br>
‚úÖ Simple and clean code structure<br>
**#Level2_Task2 completed{Assigned by Cognifyz Technologies}(Date:31/12/2024)[Password Strength Checker]**.<br>The program defines criteria for a strong password:
Minimum length of 8 characters.<br>
Contains at least one uppercase letter.<br>
Contains at least one lowercase letter.<br>
Contains at least one digit.<br>
Contains at least one special character from a defined set.<br>
The checkPasswordStrength method evaluates the password against these criteria.<br>
The main method prompts the user to enter a password, evaluates its strength, and provides feedback.<br>
**#Level2_Task3 completed{Assigned by Cognifyz Technologies}(Date:02/12/2024)[File Encryption/Decryption]**.<br>Encryption & Decryption Flexibility: Users can choose to secure or decode their text files using a Caesar cipher algorithm, making the program versatile.<br>
File Creation Capability: The program allows users to create new files directly from the application, making it a one-stop solution for text file processing.<br>
Error Handling: Ensures smooth operation with appropriate handling of invalid inputs, missing files, or unexpected errors.<br>
Dynamic Output: Saves the processed content to new files with .encrypted or .decrypted extensions, preserving the integrity of original files.<br>
Customizable Shift Value: Users can specify the encryption shift value, offering flexibility in security configurations.<br>
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Skills Demonstrated:<br>
File Handling: Reading, writing, and creating files dynamically.<br>
String Manipulation: Processing text efficiently with encryption/decryption logic.<br>
User Input Validation: Seamlessly handling different user inputs and choices.<br>
Error Management: Safeguarding the program against runtime issues.<br>
